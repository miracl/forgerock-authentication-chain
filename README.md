# MIRACL Trust Authentication Module

[MIRACL Trust速 ID](https://miracl.com) is a 100% software solution providing true two-factor authentication using the latest [Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP)](https://www.miracl.com/zero-knowledge) technology - no personal data is stored or transmitted. This eliminates the need for outdated security practices such as passwords, SMS Texts, push notifications and key-cards.

Usability is paramount, no additional user enrolment steps are required and users authenticate in one step. Without the requirement for hardware, mobiles or fiddly second steps, your users will love the simplicity and you will appreciate the reduction in support and maintenance overheads.

Provisioned as a PAYG service at a fraction of the cost of hardware solutions or SMS texts, MIRACL Trust速 ID can be integrated into any OIDC compliant platform such as ForgeRock. Capable of scaling to millions of users overnight, a combination of usability, security and cost make it possible to deploy strong MFA to large B2C networks where it was previously impossible or impractical.
MIRACL Trust速 ID makes a perfect addition to any large-scale ForgeRock installation.
